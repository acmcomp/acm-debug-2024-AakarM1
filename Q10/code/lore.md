Arron is a web developer working in BadCode LLC (tm). He completed a bootcamp on youtube and got the job from an online placement program. Unfortunately, he is not very experienced and often makes mistakes while writing codes which lead to messy codes with a lot of bugs. He needs your help urgently to fix the website he is working on. This is a benckmarking website that is meant to have standardized tests to check a machine's power to perform matrix operations. He is using a .csv file for storage as the bootcamp he followed explained SQL in a complicated manner which he did not understand.

As his code was so messy, he wanted to add comments to organise this thoughts. HOWEVER AS HE HIMSELF IS GETTING CONFUSED BY HIS OWN CODE, SOME OF HIS COMMENTS ARE INCORRECT BUT OTHERS ARE ACCURATE. He starts all his comments with the line : "Arron writes:".
