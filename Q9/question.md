# Profiles App

The Profiles App development journey has been incredibly rewarding! The process has taught me so much about building dynamic web applications and working with user data securely.

I created a profiles app, where users can sign up, create and edit their profiles, and interact with others in a personalized way.

I challenged myself by using the latest technologies and frameworks to ensure the app is modern and scalable.
From integrating authentication to implementing smooth UI/UX elements, it’s been a thrilling experience bringing everything together.

I can’t wait to continue expanding the app and exploring even more features!

I need you to please explore my site and help by fixing any errors you find, so I can move on to the next feature!

Note 1: Do not remove any libraries import statements

Note 2: The schema is already defined in the `schema.sql` file for initializing the db.

Note 3: Ignore any css issues if any, focus on the main application
